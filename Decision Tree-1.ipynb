    "Decision tree classifiers are supervised machine learning models. This means that they use prelabelled data in order to train an algorithm that can be used to make a prediction. Decision trees can also be used for regression problems.\n",
    "Decision tree classifiers work like flowcharts. Each node of a decision tree represents a decision point that splits into two leaf nodes. Each of these nodes represents the outcome of the decision and each of the decisions can also turn into decision nodes. Eventually, the different decisions will lead to a final classification.\n",
    "The top node is called the root node. Each of the decision points are called decision nodes. The final decision point is referred to as a leaf node.\n",
    "Decision trees work by splitting data into a series of binary decisions. These decisions allow you to traverse down the tree based on these decisions. You continue moving through the decisions until you end at a leaf node, which will return the predicted classification."

It is used to measure the performance of a classification model and can be used to evaluate the performance of a classification model through the calculation of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The matrix is an N X N matrix that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, where N is the number of target classes. It compares the actual target values against the ones predicted by the ML model. The confusion matrix provides a holistic view of how a classification model will work and the errors it will face."
