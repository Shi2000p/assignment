    "Elastic net regression is a regularized regression model that combines l1 and l2 penalties, lasso and ridge regression. It overcomes the limitations of the lasso method which uses a penalty function in its L1 regularization. It performs variable selection and regularization simultaneously. It finds an estimator in a two-stage procedure and minimizes the sum of error squares by applying a penalty to the coefficients. It shares the same hypothetical function for prediction as linear regression."

A more machine learning-like approach is to perform cross-validation and select the value of λ that minimizes the cross-validated sum of squared residuals (or some other measure)."

The larger the absolute value of a coefficient, the stronger the effect of the corresponding feature on the target variable. The sign of a coefficient indicates the direction of the effect: positive for positive correlation, negative for negative correlation. The coefficients that are zero indicate that the corresponding features are not relevant for the model, and they are eliminated by the lasso penalty."

This ensures you (somewhat) prevent overfitting"
